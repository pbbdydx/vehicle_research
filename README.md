## Independent research project in progress about vehicle collision 

I am using ML methods to predict the severity of vehicle collisons, using 2023 data from Pennsylvania. 

Data can be found [here](https://pennshare.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8fdbf046e36e41649bbfd9d7dd7c7e7e) and I take a great deal of methodlogical influence from [this paper](https://trid.trb.org/View/1860982). 

I am surpervised by Nicholas Stepanik, a PhD Candidate in Educational Psychology at Penn State
